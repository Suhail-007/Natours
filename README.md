<h1>NATOURS</h1>

It was quite fun to create this website, this is my first time creating a website with only float and creating nav bar and popup without js.

<h2>Navbar</h2>
navbar is created with checkbox hack.

<h2>Popup</h2>
To open and close the popup css target property is used.

<h2>Navbar</h2>
